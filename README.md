# storage validation utility
Utility to run some basic storage validation tests against a harvester installation.

The utility uses a configuration file to driver the input for the validation.

At minimal a config.yml with following information is needed

```yaml
namespace: default 
imageURL: "https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Cloud:/Images:/Leap_15.6/images/openSUSE-Leap-15.6.x86_64-NoCloud.qcow2"
storageClass: lvm
snapshotClass: lvm-snapshot
vmConfig:
  cpu: 2
  memory: 2Gi
  diskSize: 10Gi
skipCleanup: false
timeout: 600
```


Field details are as follows:

| Field | Description | Required | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| namespace | namespace to run tests in | no | "default" |
| imageURL | url to a cloud image | yes | |
| storageClass | storage class to be used for running tests | no | defauts to cluster default storage class |
| snapshotClass | snapshot class associated with storage class to be used for snapshot operations | no | defaults to a snapshot class from identified storage class |
| vmConfig.cpu | cores in provisioned VM | no | 2 |
| vmConfig.memory | memory of provisioned VM | no | 2Gi |
| vmConfig.diskSize | size of vm boot disk | no | 10Gi |
| skipClean | skip clean up of resources after validation run, useful for debugging failures | no | false |
| timeout | time in seconds to wait before timing out the validation run | no | 600 seconds |

### To run
`storage-validator` accepts following flags

```
storage-validator -h
Usage of /tmp/storage-validator:
  -config string
    	Path to config file (default "config.yaml")
  -debug
    	Debug mode
  -kubeconfig string
    	Paths to a kubeconfig. Only required if out-of-cluster.
```

Sample output of utility will be as follows

```
storage-validator -config ./sample/config.yaml
